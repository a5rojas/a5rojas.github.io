I am a first-year Data Science Ph.D. student at the University of California, San Diego working under Professors [Rose Yu](https://roseyu.com/) and [Yian Ma](https://sites.google.com/view/yianma/home). Before starting my Ph.D., I graduated from with an A.B. in Statistics & Mathematics and an S.M. in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University and wrote my thesis under Professor [David Alvarez-Melis](https://dmelis.github.io/). I also spent a year in the quantitative trading industry. 

My research interests center on improving generative models to meet real-world constraints. Specifically, I am interested how scientific and mathematical insights on the statistics and geometry of data can synergize with generative processes. I also research methods to improve the inference speed of Diffusion and Flow Matching Models.
